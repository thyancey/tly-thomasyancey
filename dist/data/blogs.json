I chose 6\" common board from Home Depot, because it was cheap, thin, sturdy, and wide enough so that I didnt have to make a lot of cuts. When I made my initial measurements and cuts, I was keeping all of the pieces close - until a friend recommended to spread them out so that water wouldn't pool in the middle. So I spaced them out at exactly the length of half of a wii-u jewel case."
